FIXITAI: AI-POWERED REPAIR ASSISTANT
Competition Submission Documentation

PROJECT OVERVIEW

FixitAI is a revolutionary mobile application that transforms how people approach DIY repairs and upcycling. Our platform combines cutting-edge artificial intelligence with a social community to democratize repair knowledge and reduce electronic waste. When users encounter broken items, instead of immediately discarding them, FixitAI provides intelligent, step-by-step repair guidance through visual analysis and natural language processing.

THE PROBLEM WE SOLVE

Every year, millions of electronic devices and household items are discarded due to minor issues that could be easily repaired. This creates massive environmental waste and unnecessary financial burden on consumers. The main barriers to DIY repairs are:
- Lack of technical knowledge and confidence
- Difficulty finding accurate repair instructions
- Fear of making things worse
- No community support for repair attempts

Our solution addresses these challenges by providing an intelligent, user-friendly platform that makes repairs accessible to everyone, regardless of their technical background.

CORE MISSION AND GOALS

Our primary mission is to promote sustainability through intelligent repair assistance while building a supportive community of DIY enthusiasts. We aim to:
- Reduce electronic waste by empowering users to repair rather than replace
- Democratize repair knowledge through AI-powered guidance
- Create a supportive community for sharing repair experiences
- Bridge the gap between DIY repairs and professional services when needed

KEY FUNCTIONALITIES

1. INTELLIGENT REPAIR WORKFLOW
The heart of FixitAI is our AI-powered repair engine. Users simply take a photo of their broken item and describe the problem in natural language. Our system then:
- Analyzes the image using computer vision to identify the device and damage
- Searches multiple repair databases including iFixit, WikiHow, and technical manuals
- Generates personalized, step-by-step repair instructions
- Provides difficulty ratings to help users assess their capability
- Offers real-time guidance throughout the repair process

2. MULTI-AGENT AI SYSTEM
Our backend employs a sophisticated multi-agent architecture where specialized AI agents collaborate:
- Vision Agent: Analyzes images and identifies device types and damage
- Research Agent: Searches repair databases and technical documentation
- Instruction Agent: Generates clear, actionable repair steps
- Safety Agent: Identifies potential hazards and provides safety warnings
- Difficulty Assessment Agent: Evaluates repair complexity for user guidance

3. SOCIAL COMMUNITY PLATFORM
FixitAI includes a vibrant social network where users can:
- Share successful repair stories with before/after photos
- Connect with other DIY enthusiasts
- Get inspiration from community repair projects
- Build reputation through helpful contributions
- Access a knowledge base of community-verified solutions

4. LOCAL EXPERT MATCHING
When repairs are too complex for DIY, our platform connects users with local repair professionals, creating a seamless transition from self-repair to professional assistance.

5. PROGRESSIVE LEARNING SYSTEM
The platform learns from user interactions to continuously improve:
- Tracks repair success rates and user feedback
- Refines difficulty assessments based on actual outcomes
- Improves instruction clarity through user testing
- Builds a knowledge base of common repair scenarios

TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE

Frontend: Flutter-based mobile application providing cross-platform compatibility with native performance. The app features an intuitive camera interface, real-time chat with AI, and social media-style feed for community interaction.

Backend: Python-based Flask API serving as the orchestration layer between the mobile app and AI services. The backend manages user sessions, handles image processing, and coordinates multi-agent AI workflows.

AI Engine: Custom-built multi-agent system using LangChain and Ollama, with specialized agents for vision analysis, research, instruction generation, and safety assessment. The system integrates with external APIs for repair database access.

Database: Firebase Firestore for real-time data synchronization, user profiles, and social interactions. Firebase Storage handles image uploads and media management.

Cloud Infrastructure: Google Cloud Platform hosting with Firebase services for authentication, real-time database, and cloud storage.

INNOVATION HIGHLIGHTS

1. AGENTIC AI APPROACH: Unlike traditional chatbots, our system uses multiple specialized AI agents that collaborate to provide comprehensive repair assistance, similar to having a team of experts working together.

2. VISUAL INTELLIGENCE: Advanced computer vision capabilities allow the system to understand device types, damage patterns, and repair requirements from simple photographs.

3. ADAPTIVE DIFFICULTY ASSESSMENT: Our AI evaluates repair complexity and user capability to provide appropriate guidance, preventing frustration and ensuring safety.

4. COMMUNITY-DRIVEN LEARNING: The platform continuously improves through user feedback and community contributions, creating a self-improving knowledge base.

5. SEAMLESS ESCALATION: When DIY repairs aren't feasible, the system smoothly transitions users to professional services rather than abandoning them.
